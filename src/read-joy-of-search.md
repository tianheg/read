As Samuel Johnson wrote, Knowledge is of two kinds. We know a subject
ourselves, or we know where we can find information upon it.

While that's true, the common version of his quote usually leaves off
the rest of his paragraph:

When we enquire into any subject, the first thing we have to do is to
know what books have treated of it. This leads us to look at catalogues,
and at the backs of books in libraries.
