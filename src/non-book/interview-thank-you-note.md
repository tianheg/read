Hi Kristin,

Thank you for the chance to interview with you yesterday. It was a great conversation, and I appreciate your considering me for the position of [position/title].

As we discussed, I’ve executed several non-traditional marketing campaigns in the last couple years, and I’m confident I’d be able to do the same with [X company you’re interviewing with].

I’m happy to answer any further questions you may have, and I’m excited about the opportunity here. I know my experience would go a long ways in helping you in your goal of reaching a new demographic of customers.

As per our conversation earlier today, I’ll expect to hear from you by the end of the week. The references you asked about are attached.  

Thank you again,

-[name]
