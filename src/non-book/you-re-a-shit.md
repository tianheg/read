> I made the personal decision to stop sulking in my own self-empathy and to start making a fucking life I can be proud of and that would make anyone who ever doubted me (or dumped me (hahahaha) absolutely furious and jealous.

我做出了选择，不让自己沉浸在自我同情之中，开始创造能让自己自豪的生活。

> The first thing that had to go was my victims mentality that stated "I can't" or any level of self-doubt or lack of faith in myself.

我必须去除我的受害者心理，从“我不能/行”开始，任何的自我怀疑和缺乏自信，都会阻止自己前进。

> Make the decision that NOTHING will hold you back, nothing will slow you down and you will accomplish the goals you never thought you could and make a life for yourself that only you are capable of. You don't need to know how, when or in what way you will do these things. Just make the decision that you will and nobody will stop you.

作出决定，没有什么能够阻止你前进，你会实现你从未想过的目标，并未你自己创造只有你才能做到的生活。

你不需要知道你将如何、何时以及或以何种方式做这些事情。只要做出你的决定，没有人能够阻止你。

> I truly hope that one day I get to hear a story of success from you. You are more than capable because we're all capable. I promise you: if I can do it, so can you. Just drop the victim's attitude and use that same energy into pushing yourself to find success.

放下受害者心态，开始推动自己找到成功。

> We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, therefore, is not an act but a habit.

> --Will Durant *The Story of Philosophy*

这句话在《哲学的故事》中讲亚里士多德的章节里，但不是亚里士多德本人的话。
